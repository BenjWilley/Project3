Attendance: All members present
Meeting minutes summary:
Major work needed in terms of frontend display. Frontend canâ€™t be ported from project 2 as project 2
used java swing which is not an availiable frontend solution. To be able to make progress on the
frontend without stalling out figuring out the framework and because most all frameworks are in
some way compatible with with HTML, we will write an HTML based frontend with CSS sheets for
aesthetics and worry about integration at a later stage. We are going to want more information on
how the frontend and backend components will work together as all parts are being worked on
seperatley (backend has super plain webpages, frontend has no functionality)

Meeting minutes summary:
Now that we have chosen to commit to .ejs we can start to make significant progress when it comes
to implementing our logic over from project 2. Most sides of the project are individually completed,
and we need to combine progress into an MVP. There is room to make the frontend more
aesthetically pleasing. As a group we are prepared to present for the team meeting on Friday with
our slide presentation.The next steps are to finish the backend implementation to then show up on
the frontend. Probably be best if we were to have more intuitive APIs to help with accessibility.

Meeting minutes summary:
From this meeting we have most of the implementation of project 2 done. As a group we are figuring
out how to effectively implement the backend into the frontend as we already have the logic and
functionality created in JavaScript. We also discussed the new implementation part that we are
gonna need such as the customer side and our more complex APIs. We now have an MVP for the end
of sprint 2 now that we have visible functionality on our application.
